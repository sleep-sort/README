Using Github to improve as a developer and organise my thoughts. Searching for a practical use for the [sleep sort](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74917807/is-there-any-practical-use-case-for-sleep-sort). Always learning, forever curious, and often distractible. [Reach out](mailto:matthewkoenig@acm.org) if you want to pair on any of my [project ideas](https://github.com/sleep-sort/content/blob/main/project-ideas.md).

I asked DALL-E to draw a self portrait and that's how I got my profile picture.
